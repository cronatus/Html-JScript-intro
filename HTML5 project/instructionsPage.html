        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This web-app has been prepared by a student of the University of the West of Scotland in order to provide a way to keep track of your bank balance easily.
        This page aims to provide instructions on how to use the app.
    </p1>
    <p>
        <u>Step 1: Setting your balance;</u><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To initially set your balance, simply input the balance of your account as a new transaction by typing it into the amount tab,
        you can leave the payee and description tabs blank if you wish. This will set your balance and every new transaction will simply add to or detract from this value.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Step 2: Your first transaction;</u><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adding a new transaction is quite simple, simply input the requested details and press enter, as you did to set your balance.<br>
        If the transaction being entered will remove money from your account indicate this by putting a minus ("-") symbol before the entered amount. However if money is
        being deposited into your account simply input the number. You do not need to enter the Â£ or $ symbol, they are unnecessary and may cause the app to crash.<br>
        <br>
        <u>Step 3: Cancelling a transaction;</u><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cancelling a transaction is as simple as clicking the Delete button at the end of it's row on the created list. <br>
        <b>Notice:</b> it is suggested that you delete everything below it before you delete the one you wish to delete as it can cause problems with the transactions that come after it, when it is deleted.
